    			JESUS SENT BY THE FATHER
FOR THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD

1. Christ reveals himself throughout his earthly life as the Saviour sent by the Father for the salvation of the world. His very name, "Jesus", expresses this mission. It actually means: "God saves".

It is a name he was given as a result of heavenly instruction: both Mary and Joseph (Lk 1:31; Mt 1:21) receive the order to call him by this name. In the message to Joseph the meaning of the name is explained: "for he will save his people from their sins".

2. Christ defines his saving mission as a service whose highest expression will be the sacrifice of his life for mankind: "For the Son of man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Mk 10:45; Mt 20:28). These words, spoken to counter the disciples’ tendency to seek the first place in the kingdom, are primarily meant to awaken in them a new mentality, which conforms more closely to that of the Teacher.

In the Book of Daniel, the figure described as "one like a son of man" is shown surrounded by the glory due to leaders who receive universal veneration: "all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him" (Dn 7:14). Jesus contrasts this figure with the Son of man who puts himself at the service of all. As a divine person, he would be fully entitled to be served. But in saying he had "come to serve", he shows a disturbing aspect of God’s behaviour: although he has the right and the power to make himself served, he puts himself "at the service" of his creatures.

Jesus is the only Saviour and MediatorJesus expresses this desire to serve in an eloquent and moving way at the Last Supper when he washes his disciples’ feet: a symbolic act which will be impressed as a rule of life on their memory for ever: "You also ought to wash one another’s feet" (Jn 13:14).

3. In saying that the Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many, Jesus is referring to the prophecy of the suffering Servant who "makes himself an offering for sin" (Is 53:10). It is a personal sacrifice, very different from the animal sacrifices used ancient worship. It is a life given "as a ransom for many", that is, for the immense multitude of humanity, for "all".</p>

            <h2>REPENTANCE</h2>
            <br>
            <p id="pqr"><b>Confession of sins is both commanded and frequently illustrated. When one is guilty of various sins, "he must confess in what way he has sinned" in order to receive atonement and forgiveness. Thus, confession belongs to repentance, and is needed for divine forgiveness. A great prophecy/ promise is given in the Book of Isaiah: "The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins".

In the New Testament, the key term for repentance is metanoia - It has two usual senses: a "change of mind" and "regret/remorse." In both books of Mark and Matthew Jesus began his public proclamation with the call "Repent." In addition, Paul is said to have preached to both Jews and Gentiles/Greeks to "turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus"</b></p>
